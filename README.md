# Mixed Clathrate-Ice Shell Convection
Numerical model, demo simulation, and code/data for modeling results figure for Geophysical research Letters manuscript "Dynamics of mixed clathrate-ice shells on ocean worlds"

Demos are contained in "wrapperTitanDemo_iceHydrates_flowModel.m" and main model is "iceHydrates_flowModel.m", the rest of the files are model dependencies. 

To create figure 3 in the manuscript, use "fig3_contourConvShutCondThickHeatFlux.m".
